Add support for Perl
--------------------

To be able to use Perl you need to create a 40Mb+ large ramdisk
in initial-conf/rc.conf. Modify, build and install a new kernel on your
flashboot device, then execute the build-script.

    # perl build-perl.pl 

Copy perl.tgz to your medias /pkg folder and perl_modules.tgz to your 
medias /perl folder. Also copy rc.perl to /conf/etc and include the
following in your rc.more.


-- cut --
if [ -f /etc/rc.perl ] ; then
	echo "********* executing /etc/rc.perl"
	. /etc/rc.perl
	echo "********* finished /etc/rc.perl"
fi
-- cut --
